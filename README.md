# pdfApp
I was annoyed at adobe acrobat for its lack of free features, so I coded this small app with basic functions for manipulating PDFs.  

## Available functions

### Merging
Merges two PDFs together, one after the other

### Trimming
Removes selected pages from a PDF

### Moving
Moves selected pages inside a PDF

### Rotating
Rotates selected pages at +90, -90 and 180 degrees

## Packages used
This program, written in python 3.8, uses the following packages:
PySimpleGUI for the user interface
PyPDF2 for manipulating PDFs
os.path for managing and saving files
